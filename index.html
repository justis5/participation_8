    <p><b>Two major advances</b> in the past contributed to the modern war machine.
      Advances in technology during <b>the Industrial Revolution</b> made weapons and
      machines <u>exponentially</u> <i>deadlier</i> and <i>effective</i>. After
      <b>The French Revolution</b>, the concept of a <i>people in arms</i> would
